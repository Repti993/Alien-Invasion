# Alien-Invasion
Simple "Alien Invasion" game based on the Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes.

Note that I have just started learning Python, therefore I have left some excessive detailed comments.

Images of ships and alien are my own creation based on the original clip art given by Eric Matthes. All are stored in the .cdr file. 

Branch EM_finished is finished game based on the Course. Master branch is version that I will keep developing
